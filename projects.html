<h2 class = "heading"> Mock University Database </h2>
<p class = "body">
  I worked with a partner to design and implement a university database, then efficiently access it on a webpage. 
  We implemented the database using PostreSQL and used the PostreSQL JDBC Driver to access it.
  We built our dynamic website to access, update, insert, and delete all data in the database with Java Server Pages on and Apache Tomcat server. 
  <br> <br>
  Following project specifications, my partner and I modeled the database with an entity-relationahip diagram, which we transferred to a relational database schema. 
  We created webpages allow the user to view and update data about courses, classes, faculty, departments, students, scholarships, and their relationships. 
  After implementing these entry forms, we designed forms to allow users to view more complex data about individual students, professors, and courses using parameterized queries. 
  To efficiently run some of these queries, we created triggers to maintain materialized views. We also used triggers to enforce constraints on data.

<h2 class = "heading">Custom Processor </h2>
<p class = "body">
  I used System Verilog to design a synthesizeable computer processor adhering to constraints and capable of carrying out three programs.
  The processor accepted fixed-length 9-bit machine code and had a byte-wide data path, byte-wide registers, and byte-wide memory locations.
  The ALU could only accept operations comparable in complexity to addition. 
  It was able calculate and compare the hamming distance, arithmetic difference, and product of combinations of 32 signed 16-bit numbers.
  <br><br>
  With the 3 programs and constraints in mind, I designed an initial ISA for the processor. 
  I wrote syntehsizeable System Verilog code to implement a processor that could carry out this ISA and created an initial testbench 
  for the processor. 
  Using Java, I coded an assembler for the ISA. In the final Milestone, I wrote the assembly for each program and 
  tested and debugged the processor and each program using ModelSim.

<p class = "body">
  My group created a Java application to generate and store unique recipes given certain ingredients.
  We used JavaFX to implement a responsive user interface, the ChatGPT API to generate unique recipes, 
  the Whisper API to recognize voice input, and MongoDB to store user recipes on the cloud. We created an 
  HTTP server to separate backend logic.
  <br><br>
  Throughout the project, we followed an Agile Development process. We created user stories from End-to-End scenarios, strove to eliminate ambiguity,
  wrote BDD scenarios for each user stories, separated user stories into tasks, made time estimates for tasks and user stories,
  accounted for velocity,
  planned iterations and Milestones, and tested features with unit and story tests. We also designed and refactored our
  code to follow Object-Oriented principles and design patterns, including the single responsibility principle, the Strategy Pattern, and the Model-View-Presenter pattern.

<p class = "body">
  Quick To-Do is a command-line task manager designed to be simple to use while providing the user easy-to-understand and 
  optional features to organize and display tasks. Users can add, list, modify, and remove tasks with a label. They can optionally
  add a due date and time, priority level, description, and tag to each task to modify how tasks are displayed, sorted, and found. Detailed
  feedback and documentation for all options can be found within 
  the application or on GitHub.
  <br><br>
  I learned the picocli library to implement command-line functionality and provide feedback. I used GraalVM to compile the 
  application into a stand-alone executable. To follow convention and use picocli, I researched and used the structure of typical 
  command-line applications. In order to read data from local files to be represented as objects, I created a custom wrapper class.

<p class = "body">

  Simple Chess is an interface with which users can manipulate chess pieces on a board. It an HTML website with CSS 
  and JavaScript. The site features original SVG piece models and uses HTML text validation to validate usernames. I created this website to solidify what I learned from an online front-end course.
