Throughout college, I have had to accept that I can't pursue every opportunity. Dozens of majors would provide a fascinating career path, I could spend a lifetime taking all of the courses I would like to, and there are so many student organizations it becomes tedious to read through them.

Thus the importance of taking advantage of the opportunities I can. I have pursued a fascination in Cognitive Science, a field I previously didn’t know existed. I found incredible people in classes, organizations, and working at a dining hall. I applied data structures and algorithms inside and out of the classroom, used agile development and object oriented programming, and practiced my understanding of relational databases.

Off campus, I've come to appreciate the simple opportunities. I don't need a degree to spend time with family, complete Cyberpunk 2077, or enjoy a game of chess, yet never before have these been more important to me.

As I finish my undergraduate education and transition to the next step of my career, I can’t wait to see what new opportunities present themselves.
